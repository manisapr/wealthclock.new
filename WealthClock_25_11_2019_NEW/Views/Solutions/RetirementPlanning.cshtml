                            <h4>Inefficient budgeting</h4>
                            <p>

                                The ever increasing expenses are not always met with proportional income increments. Over the past decade average inflation rate has been XX whereas the average increment is only XX. And every increase in income bring increase in expenses such as better house, better cars and a better lifestyle in general. This inefficient budgeting of income causes people to feel that they do not enough money to earmark for retirement.

                            <p>

                                People are not likely to think about retirement funds when they are in their hay days. This is a common mistake made by many young hard working individuals who believe that retirement is too far to worry about. It is much later that the importance of retirement fund dawns to them. This risk can be voided by timely planning how you use your hard earned money.

                            <p>

                                A man earns to meet many ends such as new house, holidays or a wedding. Often in the list of things one saves for, retirement fund does not enjoy a position of priority. Timely highlighting the importance of such retirement fund can make the difference between a comfortable and secure retirement sum or an inadequate fund.
